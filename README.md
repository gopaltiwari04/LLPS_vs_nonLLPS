Living cells organize molecules not only with membrane-bound organelles (like nuclei or mitochondria) but also by forming membraneless compartments. These are dense liquid-like droplets called biomolecular condensates or biocondensates . LLPS is a physical phase transition where a uniform mixture (of proteins/RNA) separates into two liquid phases (a dense droplet phase and a dilute phase) . In other words, some proteins “demix” from the watery environment to form a concentrated liquid droplet inside the cell. LLPS is important because it underlies many biological processes– for example, gene regulation, stress response, and protein/RNA processing happen in these droplets . Identifying which proteins can undergo LLPS helps us understand how cells form these compartments and how misregulation might lead to disease.
Certain proteins drive LLPS by having features that make them stick together in a droplet. Often these proteins have intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) or prion-like domains – flexible parts of the sequence that promote weak multivalent interactions . Many RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, or stress-granule components are LLPS drivers. We call a protein an LLPS protein if it can form or participate in these liquid compartments. Some LLPS proteins can self-assemble into droplets alone (called self-assembling), while others need partners (like RNA or other proteins) to phase separate (called partner dependent) . Because LLPS is linked to processes like gene control and diseases (e.g. neurodegeneration) , finding all potential LLPS proteins and understanding their mechanism is very useful. The two papers we discuss propose machine-learning tools to do exactly this: predict which proteins undergo LLPS and how (with or without partners), and even which amino acids (key residues) in those proteins are most critical for phase separation.
